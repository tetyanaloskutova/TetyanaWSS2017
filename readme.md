# WSS2017 WikiMap Project by Tetyana Loskutova

(*what your project is about*)
Semantic maps are maps or webs of words. The purpose of creating a map is to visually display the meaning-based connections between a word or phrase and a set of related words or concepts.

## WikMap Project Goals
a nice cheatsheet can be found here: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
 

## (* how to run your code *)
## (* examples, code documentation, etc *)

## Organize your code
in this repository you will find 2 different ways to organize your code, the simple way and the programmer way.


### The programmer way
I prepared a very simple project paclet you can use, it provides a way to organize your code and your data

1. the code is in paclet in `starthere/Project` folder
2. raw source data can be put in `starthere/Project/Assets/` folder
3. the notebook used for visualization is in `starthere/advanced.nb`
